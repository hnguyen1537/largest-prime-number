Find the largest positive prime number <= n.
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 whose only actors are 1 and the number itself. That is, it can only be divided equally by 1 and itself.

Natural numbers are positive integers such as 1, 5, 201, 229999, etc. The number 0, fractions, decimals, and negative numbers are not natural numbers.

For example: 

* if `n = 50`, `num` should be `47`
* if `n = 7`; `num` should be `7`
* if `n = 1`; `num` should be `undefined`
